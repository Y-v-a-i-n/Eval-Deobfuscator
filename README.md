# A simple Eval Deobfuscator in JavaScript that I made just for fun and out of boredom 
### Just replace eval with console.log and execute the code to get the content (WARNING!! CODE CAN BE EXECUTED IN A CONSOLE.LOG EXAMPLE : `console.log(console.log("Hello World"))` YOU MUST THEREFORE EXECUTE THESE CODES IN A SECURE ENVIRONMENT)
### How to launch Eval Deobfuscator : 
* you must first install electronJs on your machine
```sh
$ npm install electron -g
```
* then you have to run the program with electron, for that you can run this command at the location of the index.js file, you can also run run.bat or run.sh
```sh
$ electron index.js
```
